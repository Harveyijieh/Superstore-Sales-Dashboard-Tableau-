🎯 Project Objectives

    Create an interactive Tableau dashboard that delivers sales insights in a clear and engaging format.

    Enable stakeholders to explore trends across categories, regions, segments, and time.

    Demonstrate skills in data analysis, storytelling, and dashboard design.

🔍 Business Questions

This project seeks to answer key questions relevant to retail decision-makers:

    What regions and states drive the most profit or incur losses?

    Which product categories and sub-categories perform best?

    How does the customer segment affect sales and profitability?

    What impact does discounting have on overall profit margins?

    Are certain shipping methods more cost-effective?

📈 Key Insights

Some of the interesting findings include:

    📉 The Central region shows strong sales but low profitability due to heavy discounting.

    🛒 Technology category yields the highest profit margin despite fewer sales.

    ⚠️ Tables sub-category consistently results in negative profit across regions.

    🚚 Standard Class is the most used shipping mode but is not always the most profitable.
